# Rotation

For many games and other usages of grids, you never need to worry about rotating things. In chess, for example, the units move in fixed patterns. Or for a height map, you just need a single number per cell.

But in other usages, the facing direction of objects matters, or you wish to re-use the same tile image in a different orientation. For these, sooner or later, you'll need to worry about rotations.
