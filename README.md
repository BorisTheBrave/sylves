# Sylves

Sylves is a C# library for to help you handle working with 2d and 3d grids.

If you are just interested in _square_ grids, then you probably don't need a library - the maths is very simple. 
But Sylves handles a huge variety of regular and irregular grids ([full list](TODO)), and comes with all the methods you need for any game.

The key features include:
 * Support for 2d tilings and 3d honeycomb grids.
 * A common grid and cell interface so you can write algorithms that work on any grid.
 * An integrated understanding of orientation and rotation for grid entities.
 * Methods for working with meshes, such as remeshing, and deforming them to fit a grid cells.
 * Fully Unity compatible, or works as a standalone library.
